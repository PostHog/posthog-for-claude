# Search

Use the PostHog MCP tools to help the user search across all entities:

1. To search across all PostHog entities (insights, dashboards, feature flags, experiments, actions, cohorts, etc.), use `posthog_entity_search`

## Example prompts

- "Search for anything related to checkout"
- "Find all dashboards mentioning revenue"
- "Search for signup-related insights"
- "What entities reference the purchase event?"
- "Find everything related to onboarding"
