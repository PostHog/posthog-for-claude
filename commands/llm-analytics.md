# LLM Analytics

Use the PostHog MCP tools to help the user with LLM and AI cost tracking:

1. To get LLM costs and usage data, use `posthog_get_llm_costs`
2. Help the user understand their AI spending by model, prompt, or time period
3. Identify expensive prompts and opportunities for optimization

## Example prompts

- "What are my LLM costs this week?"
- "Show me AI usage by model"
- "Which prompts are most expensive?"
- "How much have I spent on GPT-4 this month?"
